# SVMs from NumPy Implementations 
* In this code I implemented Support Vector Machine (SVMs) both with and without slack formulations. This experiment implemented with 4 Kernels
and grid search on hyper-parameters on different kernels from NumPy implementation from scratch, and also implementedfrom standard Python library, LibSVM for solving optmization
problem. 
* Implementation also for multi-class classification, implemented be  a one-vs-rest approach.
